Gradle plugin enforces licenses of dependencies to comply with definitions.

	// ...
    id("com.namics.oss.gradle.license-enforce-plugin") version "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
}

tasks.enforceLicenses {
    allowedCategories = listOf("Apache", "BSD", "LGPL", "MIT", "ISC", "MPL")
}
```

Invoke:

gradle enforceLicenses
```

## Development

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

> [Full explanation](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

#### Examples

Appears under "Features" header, pencil subheader:

```
feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option
```

Appears under "Bug Fixes" header, graphite subheader, with a link to issue #28:

```
fix(graphite): stop graphite breaking when width < 0.1

Closes #28
```

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

If the prefix is `feat`, `fix` or `perf`, it will appear in the changelog. However if there is any [BREAKING CHANGE](#footer), the commit will always appear in the changelog.

Other prefixes are up to your discretion. Suggested prefixes are `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`, and `test` for non-changelog related tasks.

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `$location`,
`$browser`, `$compile`, `$rootScope`, `ngHref`, `ngClick`, `ngView`, etc...

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
